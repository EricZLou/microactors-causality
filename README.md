# microactors-causality

This repository uses GitHub Actions and Tigramite to maintain causality information and plots. 

### What this does

   1. Tests the current version of Tigramite package from github
   2. Creates pretty pictures

Thus it serves to test the tigramite package master branch

### Intended usage 

You can retrieve data directly from JSON files in [/data](https://github.com/microprediction/microactors-causality/tree/main/data). Should you wish to create your
own variation, then simply:

  1. Fork
  2. Enable GitHub actions
  
### Gallery

See [/gallery](https://github.com/microprediction/microactors-causality/tree/main/gallery) for causality maps like this, where each column is a time step.
